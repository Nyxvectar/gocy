For Go Language Refresh, Quick personal exercises for brushing up on Go fundamentals.       

This repository contains code snippets and small practice programs  I  created  while
revisiting core Go concepts. It serves as my personal learning sandbox,  not a formal
project or production-ready code, in order to refresh syntax,  concurrency  patterns,
and standard library usage, experiment with language features,maintain coding fluency
between projects.       

Structure follows my revising flow ,  feel  free  to  explore ,  but  expect  minimal
documentation. Contributions not expected as this is purely a personal reference.       

Happy coding.
